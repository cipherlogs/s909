# Season 1
### Your Mission
Venture into the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges using VIM. Each day, face puzzles with two interconnected parts, demanding a unique approach. This global challenge unites programmers to solve puzzles, but this time, the twist is relying solely on VIM, to crack the codes.

<br>

### Challenges Redefined
These challenges, originally designed for programming languages, become opportunities to showcase VIM's power in solving low-level complex problems and our daily sprint instructions make puzzles trickier, maximizing learning potential.

### Journey Highlights
This journey will be a true test of your VIM skills and your ability to think creatively and resourcefully. You'll discover new ways to use VIM, pushing it beyond its perceived limitations. And as you progress, you'll gain a deeper understanding of VIM's philosophy, its emphasis on efficiency and control.


**Every day, you'll put yourself in two scenarios:**

1. **Daily Job Dilemma:** Picture this: a challenge lands on your desk during your regular workday. You need to master solving it swiftly to get back to your real job. A crucial skill for VIM users.

2. **The Future-Proof Solution:** Now, assume the challenge might become a recurring guest on your desk. Solve it in a way that's scalable—write a Vimscript that conquers today's problem and remains resilient as the problem evolves.

Every day, produce four solutions—one for each part of both scenarios. It's not a suggestion; it's a requirement for advancement. Your progress to the next day depends on it.

## Why Advent of Code?

1. **Speedy and Elegant:** The puzzles are cleverly designed; rushing through the first part often means doubling down on effort for the second. It's about thinking ahead and scaling your solutions. Master crafting elegant, efficient solutions using VIM—an unprecedented journey into the world of Vim. Create robust solutions surpassing those in programming languages, emphasizing conciseness and speed of development.

2. **Thinking Outside the Box:** If you've faced these challenges before, that's fantastic. Now, envision solving them with VIM, where you'll need to embrace the VIM philosophy and think creatively.
