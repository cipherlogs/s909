# Your Mission

<br>

Every day, you will face puzzles with two interconnected parts, demanding a unique approach. You will join programmers from around the world in solving these puzzles, but with a twist: **you will only use VIM and unix utils to crack the codes.**

This journey will challenge your VIM skills and your creative and resourceful thinking. You will explore new possibilities with VIM, going beyond what you thought it could do. And as you advance through the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles, you will transform yourself.

<br>

### Challenges Redefined
These challenges are low-level tasks that most people solve using their favorite programming language. There is a big condition that you have to meet for your solutions to count.

You have to come up with solutions that are faster to compose than the programming language equivalents.

<br>

**Every day, you'll put yourself in two scenarios:**

1. **Rapid Editing:** Imagine this: you are busy editing some text in VIM, when suddenly a challenge pops up on the same file you are working on. You have to solve it quickly to resume your original task. speed is key here.

2. **Future-Proof:** Suppose the challenge is not a one-time event, but a frequent occurrence. You need to solve it in a way that’s adaptable and scalable by writing a Vimscript that handles today’s problem and can cope with future changes.
