# Your Mission
<br>

Every day, you will face real challenges with two interconnected parts, demanding a unique approach. You will join programmers from around the world in solving these puzzles, but with a twist: **you will only use VIM and unix utils.**

This journey will challenge your skills and your creative and resourceful thinking. You will explore new possibilities with VIM, going beyond what you thought it could do. And as you advance through the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles, you will transform yourself.

<br>

### Challenges Redefined
These challenges are low-level tasks that most people solve using their favorite programming language. There is a big condition that you have to meet for your solutions to count.

**You have to come up with solutions that are faster to compose than the programming language equivalents.**

<br>

**Every day, you'll practice two skills:**

1. **Speed:** Imagine this: you are busy editing some text in VIM, when suddenly a challenge pops up on the same file you are working on. You have to solve it quickly with motions and commands to resume your original task. speed is key here.

2. **Future-Proof:** Suppose the challenge is not a one-time event, but a frequent occurrence. You need to solve it in a way that’s adaptable and scalable by writing a Vimscript that handles today’s problem and can cope with future changes.

### Curriculum and Public Lectures
To access the official Curriculum, please use Discord if you are enrolled in this sprint.

For those who are not enrolled in the program, we are making the following Walkthrough videos available to the public. You can watch them to get a glimpse of what the program offers, understand the concepts, and even experiment with your own text editors. However, you will not be able to join the first season directly if you are not a VIM user.
