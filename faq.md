# Season 1

**Why Vimscript instead of lua**?

Vimscript is integrated so well with the editor that it feels the same whether you’re writing a script or just composing a couple of commands. The results can also be short and concise, any newcomer can start seeing big returns on their investments fast.

If we decide to design plugins in season 2, I’ll probably choose Lua. However, for now, I don’t think it’s worth it to use Lua *unless you are familiar with it*.
