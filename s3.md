# The final season
In season 3, success is crystal clear: every product we launch must bring in the cash—no ifs, ands, or buts. With the diverse skill set acquired in season 2, you'll channel that expertise into crafting products and services that people willingly pay for. If they don't, **it's a failure.**

I know you might be wondering why this matters. Let me take you back to my early career when I launched several mailing utilities—maybe you even used one. Among the successes was a tool that effortlessly configured SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for your email's domain. It wasn't flashy, but it was widely used. A couple of clicks, and your email domain was set up without any technical know-how.

That moment marked a turning point for me. I realized that I had created something people actually needed. It motivated me to dive into complex topics and learn more. That's the first point.
The second point is that there's nothing worse than seeing someone with fewer skills than you achieve more success and reach the heights you deserve. In theory, you're the man for the job because you possess better skills, but in reality, you don't deserve it—**and I confirm this.**

This is a huge problem that many programmers face, and it's not commonly taught unless you aspire to become an entrepreneur. But these skills are essential. What's the point of having no vision, not understanding the market, or not knowing how to study it? What's the point of not grasping others' pain and not speaking their language?

The successful Micro-SaaS products I've created, as well as the failed ones, have significantly shaped my life philosophy—even when I sought to join better teams. In my resume, I never mention my skills; personally, I find it useless. Instead, I focus on my projects and their impact. That's the same concept I use when hiring people—show me what you did, show me the impact they had; I don't care about the rest.
That's why my teaching approach is all about giving you the tools and confidence to go out there and make a real difference. Once you've tasted the sweet satisfaction of creating something that people actually **want and need**, you'll be unstoppable. You'll have the wisdom and drive to pursue your next goals with unwavering confidence.

Even in the face of challenges, in season 3, you'll witness me building from the ground up multiple times. Your task is to do the same at least once. 

Whether you're flying solo or part of a team, the objective stays constant: crafting at least one successful product that brings in revenue.
