## 1. Getting Started
Today, you'll see firsthand how solving the entire puzzle using VIM is faster than writing code from scratch.

To begin, access [today's challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) and carefully read the instructions below before attempting to solve it.

### 1.1 Rules
1. In the first scenario, if you plan to hard code all possible outcomes of the game, avoid manual entry. Instead, find an automatic way to handle them. Imagine having one million potential outcomes for the game—your approach should be automated for speed. Utilize your editor for efficiency. **Remember, the emphasis in the first scenario is on speed.**

2. In the second scenario, write a Vimscript that accommodates the worst-case scenario. Consider a situation where each symbol might signify something else in the future. Structure your code to distinctly separate the game logic from symbol deciphering.


### 1.2 Help
Whenever you encounter a knowledge gap or a comprehension issue, seek assistance from your team, docs and Google. Take your time and avoid rushing. 
The goal is not to solve puzzles for their own sake, but to learn and gain more insights than others.

## 2. Solutions
Before looking at the solutions, attempt to solve the problems by yourself or with your team’s support.
You can access the written guide with the exercises at **cipherlogs.com**. The walkthrough video is available on YouTube

Good luck!
