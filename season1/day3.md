# Day3
## 1. Getting Started
To begin, access [today's challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3) and carefully read the instructions below before attempting to solve it.

### 1.1 Rules
1. In the first scenario, refrain from creating low-level functions that involve iterating through strings to extract duplicated characters. Instead, leverage built-in Vimscript functions creatively or utilize Unix utilities. Alternatively, if achieving the desired results promptly requires a one-liner in a programming language, that approach is acceptable. However, avoid reinventing the wheel; the emphasis is on efficiency in this speed-focused scenario.

2. In the second scenario, pay attention to the following considerations:
   + The initial aspect of the challenge involves splitting each line in half. However, the script should be flexible enough to allow for splitting into thirds, quarters, or any other specified interval. Ensure your script is capable of dynamically handling different split configurations.

   + For the first part of the challenge, when splitting each line into segments of size 'n,' retain only those chunks that match the specified size. For instance, if 'abcdefgh' is split into groups of 3, the desired result should be `['abc', 'def']`.
   
   + The second part of the challenge focuses on joining lines in groups of 3. Extend the script's capability to accommodate future needs for joining lines in groups of 5, 7, or any other specified interval `n`. Ensure your script is adaptable to varying group sizes.

### 1.2 Help
Whenever you encounter a knowledge gap or a comprehension issue, seek assistance from your team, docs and Google. Take your time and avoid rushing. 
The goal is not to solve puzzles for their own sake, but to learn and gain more insights than others.

## 2. Solutions
Before looking at the solutions, attempt to solve the problems by yourself or with your teamâ€™s support.
